            <h3>User stories</h3>
              <p>
                I started to think about the features users would need in this cloud storage app. With personas in mind, I created a range of user stories. <span>The most challenging part of this task was identifying the priorities of certain actions</span>. I made decisions about the direction in which I wanted the design to go, and I would later find out that for many tasks the weight I initially assigned changed throughout the design process.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, I originally placed stories about saving content such as documents, images, videos and links in the high priority category. Later on, when doing my mockups <span>I realized that the web-clipping feature I created to fulfill these stories introduced scope creep</span>. Still, laying out all the possibilities of the app’s potential was worthwhile because it showed additional components that could be added in a future version, i.e. a webclip plugin.

              <p>
                I mapped out the high-priority user stories to eventually test with users. I included processes for signing up, signing in, uploading files, organizing items, saving content, sharing and receiving shared items. Thinking about the actions for each step helped me to view each task from different user perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, one user might choose to sign up through Google and another user might prefer signing up through the app itself. Even a simple signup process can become complex when mapping out user flows, and it was a reminder of the importance of considering all possible decision points for potential users.

              My first wireframes were very basic. I wanted to show the structure alone without the content, so there were no images, only buttons, icons and minimal text. I soon realized the importance of giving the wireframes some context so that they would make sense in the clickable prototype, so I refined them to include more detail, mainly in text form.

              My second set of wireframes were used to put together a clickable prototype, which I used in the first round of usability testing.<span>The first user feedback I got was mostly about content clarity</span>. For example, one of my participants pointed out that I had shown the pricing plans in an order that did not make sense to her. Another participant had expected to see a call-to-action in the pricing section.

              My last participant struggled with finding the button to upload content, which was confusing because it was not consistent with other buttons in the prototype. <span>I made a note of improvements to make for the next iteration</span>, and I got confirmation that other than these few hiccups the prototype was easy to use and made for a simple user experience.

          <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>
              Through brainstorming brand ideas I came up with the idea to call the app Camelot. The initial train of thought was of a camel, known for being able to store large amounts of water (actually fat) in their humps, as a metaphor for the app’s ability to store large amounts of data in the cloud.  I thought this could work because Camelot is known as the great castle associated with King Arthur. With the main brand differentiators being the unlimited storage and security features, I wanted these concepts to be present in the logo.
            </p>
          </div>
            <figure class="camel-logo">

          <div class="text-logo-2">
            <p>
              I later nixed the camel concept, worried that camels also conjure images of the desert and scarcity. I did not want such thoughts associated with the brand, however, I held onto Camelot. Inspired by King Arthur’s chief fortress, the legendary castle where he and his knights would collaborate at the Round Table, the Camelot brand draws parallels in that users collect, organize and collaborate in a private and secure place. <span>The logo includes a cloud surrounding a castle containing a keyhole, echoing values of privacy and security</span>, and in the negative space reveals a watchdog to evoke an additional sense of protection.

                The style guide I created would serve as a set of standards for various assets within the brand. I included all logo configurations and directions for proper and improper logo use. I created a color palette. I chose dark teal for the logo and text color because it has the stable, trustworthy qualities of blue, and optimistic, harmonic properties of green. The contrasting oranges in my palette are energizing and I thought would serve well for calls to action and links. For the background color I chose the almost white light blue, a tint of the dark teal, which contrasts well with the other hues.

          <h3>Prototypes</h3>
            <p>
              My first iteration was solid but it revealed that I had made some functions of the app redundant. For example, I had separate screens for different actions when each screen was roughly the same layout but with a different title. For my second iteration I combined these actions directly on the dashboard, which made navigation much smoother.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using my high fidelity mockups, I created a clickable prototype and performed another round of user tests. <span>Usability testing revealed that I had some vital changes to make to my prototypes</span>. For one, users pointed out that I had completely missed including a way for users to sign out of the mobile app. Another change motivated by user test results was to eliminate the three dots “more” icon and include icons for the move and share actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I was observing I also realized that I didn’t make it clear how one would share multiple items. I had initially thought users could select a few by clicking on multiple items and then hit the “more” icon, but this action lacked signifiers so users didn’t know this was possible. I determined a solution to use checkboxes in combination with the “move” and “share” icons, which would resolve the issues my participants had with these actions in one swoop.

          <h3>Preference testing</h3>
            <p>
              For more user feedback, I tested three elements in my design where I considered more than one potential style. The first was simply whether a button should be square with rounded corners or completely rounded. Initially, 67% of participants said they preferred the rounded option, however I only had 12 responses so the difference was not statistically significant. I repeated this test later on and increased the white space around each button to make sure that I wasn’t creating a bias due to perceived crowding of the element, and with 21 responses I got the exact same result: <span>67% preferred the rounded button</span>. I had initially decided on the square buttons, but I changed the shape of my buttons to reflect this preference.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second test was which popup screen I should use, and <span>69% of participants chose the centered popup</span> over the side popup. This was the style I chose initially, so I simply kept this screen the same. The last test was on the color scheme, and whether the side bar should be dark and the rest of the screen light  or vise versa. With <span>83% of participants confirming my preference for the light majority</span>, I kept this screen as is as well.

                Through the design process I created a simple interface for users to navigate their cloud storage needs. In reflecting on this project, my biggest takeaway was how complex the design process is, from start to finish, and how valuable each step is in creating a worthwhile product. <span>While parts can be tedious, more research, testing and thoughtful branding leads to a stronger design</span>.  User testing can quickly point out issues that you were initially blind to, and iteration, though taxing, always produces results.

                If I had more time, I would do a second survey. Once I progressed further in the project, I thought of more questions to ask and got clarity on how I could have asked some of my questions differently. Having more input early on could have given me more confidence in my early designs. I would also spend more time on the visual design of the site, perhaps adding more texture or images to enhance aesthetics. In future projects, I will continue to rely heavily on user feedback early and often in the design process and reflect thoroughly on how each step can provide key insights to move forward.
